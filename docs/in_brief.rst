In brief
========

HydrOffice is a research development environment for ocean mapping. It provides a collection of hydro-packages, each of them dealing with a specific issue of the field.
The main goal is to speed up both algorithms testing and research-2-operation.

BAG Explorer is a light application, based on HDF Compass and the HydrOffice BAG library tools, to explore BAG data files.

HDF Compass is written in Python, but ships as a native application on Windows, OS X, and Linux, by using PyInstaller and Py2App to package the app.
For more info about HDF Compass, visit the `GitHub <http://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf-compass>`_ repository and the `project <https://www.hdfgroup.org/projects/compass/>`_ web page.

HydrOffice BAG library provides access to BAG-specific features, as well as a collection of tools to verify and manipulate BAG data files.
